# Data Visualization
# Dataset
Based on a dataset from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/52000-animation-movie-details-dataset-2024), this project aims to investigate the correlation between the animation's popularity and revenue and the correlation between run time and revenue by using linear regression models. 
The dataset from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/52000-animation-movie-details-dataset-2024), uploaded by ASANICZKA, has data about animation movies, which is scraped from the TMDB API. This dataset examines animation movies' performances in different aspects, including revenue, runtime, etc. It includes 23 variables, such as id, title, vote_average, vote_count, status, release_date, revenue, etc, and 51945 observations.
# Research Question
My project aims to investigate the correlation between the animation's popularity and revenue and the correlation between movies' run time and revenue. I hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between popularity and revenue, and no correlation between runtime and revenue.
# Variables of interest
The variables of interest are popularity, revenue, and runtime.
- popularity: Popularity score of the movie; it's a numerical data.
- revenue: Revenue generated by the animation movie; it's a numerical data.
- runtime: The duration of the animation movie; it's a numerical data; unit of variable is minutes.
# Discussion of research results
To explore the correlation between the animation's popularity and revenue, as well as between movies' run time and revenue, I first used line plots to identify the data patterns and trends. In both plots, smooth lines indicate a positive correlation between the variables. However, each plot reveals distinct trends. For the first plot, there are peaks in popularity of approximately 50 and 400. The second plot has a prominent peak when the runtime is around 100. Since both the figures have unique peaks, I want to further visualize the correlation by plotting them into box plots, which can provide a clearer understanding of the data peaks and the correlation between them.

To further explore the data distribution and identify outliers, I categorize data into groups and create box plots. For the correlation between popularity and revenue, the box plots show that as popularity increases, the range of the data expands, and the median of revenue increases, indicating a positive correlation. What is also worth noticing is that for the first plot (popularity 0 to 200), there are a lot of outliers, indicating a lot of exceptional cases within this popularity range.

The correlation between movies' runtime and revenue seems more complex. As runtime increases, the median of the revenue has a very gradual increase. Then, comparing two specific groups--one with runtimes ranging from 50 to 75 and another from 75 to 100--the boxplot range doesn't change much. However, comparing the group with a runtime ranging from 75 to 100 and the group ranging from 100 to 125, the boxplot range expands, and it shows that the first and second quartile for movies with a runtime of 100-125 obtains a much higher revenue. What is also worth noticing is that for the second plot (runtime 75 to 100), there are a lot of outliers, indicating a lot of exceptional cases within this runtime range.

In conclusion, there is a positive correlation between movies' popularity and revenue, and when popularity ranges from 0 to 200, there are a lot of exceptional cases; there is a positive correlation between movies' runtime and revenue, but when runtime ranges from 75 to 100, there are a lot of exceptional cases. While there's an overall positive correlation, when the runtime ranges from 50 to 100, the increase in runtime does not necessarily lead to an increase in revenue. The positive correlation between runtime and revenue becomes apparent when the runtime is around 100. Specifically, when the runtime is higher than 100, the revenue is much higher than those with shorter runtime (runtime lower than 100).
